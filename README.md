# Money, or Where It All Goes

This has been a project that I have wanted to make for some time now. I have long seen other financial programs that do not allow you to see specifically where all of your money goes per your own categorizations, and so I set out to make it.

In the future, I hope to have a fully functioning program with a nice GUI that will let a user create or use an existing file to see where they are spending. I hope to have fully customizable categories as well. I also hope to make a program that will let users see charts and graphs of spending.
