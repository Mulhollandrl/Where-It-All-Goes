# Money, or Where It All Goes

This has been a project that I have wanted to make for some time now. I have long sought for an open source project that lets you see graphs and data analysis on your spending habits, per your own categorization.

I hope for this to one day have encrypted files with its own file extension, ways to load and make new save files, and options for what type of data analysis to display.
